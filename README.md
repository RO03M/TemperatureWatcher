# TemperatureWatcher
A watcher app, to check pc temperatures

Was worried about my pc temperatures when playing and didn't want to download any of those monitoring programs, so decided to check out how to make one. Tried to do in c++, but it looks very difficult for a simple project, so decided to make in c# that has more accessibility to windows and other stuff. But for getting the temperatures I had to use a lib called "OpenHardwareMonitor", because of the same reason with c++, needed to write my own driver or something to get data from hardware.
